**Process**

Data Analysis:

- Scrutinized network traffic volume trends to identify potential threats, such as DDoS attacks and credential stuffing attempts.
- Conducted targeted mitigation efforts by concentrating on potential attackers and prioritizing threat response.
- Performed trend analysis to forecast potential escalation points and anomalous authentication patterns, informing patching and mitigation strategies.

---

**Analysis**

1.	Network Traffic Volume Over Time:
- Significant variation in the number of malware attacks over the 12-month period
- Identified peak months with higher attack volumes (months 2, 4, 6)
- Tracked "IOC Detected" vs. "No Detection" cases to evaluate security control effectiveness
 
2.	Top Sources of Malicious Traffic:
- Balanced traffic distribution across DNS (33.4%), HTTP (33.4%), and FTP (33.2%) protocols
- Provides a baseline for monitoring changes and anomalies in the future
- Informs capacity planning and resource allocation decisions
 
3.	Types of Detected Threats:
- Evenly distributed attack types: DDoS (33.6%), Malware (33.3%), Intrusion (33.2%)
- Comprehensive security strategy required to address all three attack types effectively
- Guides incident response, mitigation, and threat intelligence efforts
 
4: User Authentication Attempts
- Highest attack volume on TCP protocol, followed by UDP and ICMP
- Insights into attack vectors and protocol-specific vulnerabilities
- Supports incident response and mitigation planning, as well as threat research
 
5. Vulnerability Status by System and Severity:
- Wide range of packet lengths observed for different attack types (Malware, Intrusion, DDoS)
- Distinct packet length distributions can be used for anomaly detection and signature-based protection
- Correlation with other security metrics can provide a more comprehensive view of the threat landscape

**Share**

1. DDoS Attack Detection:
- Recognized patterns of excessive traffic volume and specific packet characteristics indicative of DDoS attacks.
- Recommended activating DDoS mitigation tools and alerting the IT security team.

2. Credential Stuffing:
- Identified patterns of multiple login attempts from different IP addresses within short time frames, indicative of credential stuffing attacks.
- Recommended implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and locking accounts after several failed attempts.

3. Insider Threats:
- Detected unusual access patterns to sensitive data by internal employees, potentially indicating insider threats.
- Recommended conducting thorough investigations and enforcing least-privilege access controls.
