關於我的學習和工作的項目，但數據已更改為不同的數據，以適應數據隱私

# 學習歷程
開始程式學習的旅程，以數據安全為核心。掌握Python基礎語法和數據處理技巧，特別關注在使用Pandas和Numpy進行數據分析時如何保護數據的完整性和機密性。學習SQL時，不僅熟悉查詢語法、資料庫設計和管理，還專注於數據庫的安全性管理，確保數據存取的安全。

進一步學習Power BI，理解數據視覺化的同時，重視數據在視覺化過程中的安全傳輸和展示，熟練使用其功能創建安全的報表和儀表板，以支持數據驅動的決策。Excel的學習也不例外，深入掌握數據分析功能的同時，注重在使用函數、樞紐分析表和數據透視表過程中的數據保護措施，提升數據處理和分析的安全性。

在數據分析領域，學習各種統計方法和機器學習算法時，優先考慮數據隱私保護和模型的安全性，確保應用這些技術進行預測分析和模型建立時數據不被洩露或篡改，為實際業務問題提供安全可靠的解決方案。

最後，全面了解資訊安全的基本概念和最佳實踐，學會如何在整個數據處理和分析過程中保護數據的完整性和機密性，從而全面提升技術能力，成為一名專注於數據安全的全能數據專業人才。

# Learning Journey

The journey of learning programming began with a focus on data security. Starting with Python, mastering basic syntax and data processing techniques, there was always an emphasis on protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data, especially when using Pandas and Numpy for data analysis. Learning SQL involved not only understanding query syntax, database design, and management but also prioritizing database security to ensure safe data access.

Progressing to Power BI, the aim was to understand data visualization while ensuring secure data transmission and display, using its features to create secure reports and dashboards that support data-driven decision-making. Excel was also a key part of this journey, with a deep dive into its data analysis functions, including functions, pivot tables, and data pivots, while focusing on data protection measures to enhance the safety of data processing and analysis.

In the field of data analysis, learning various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms was accompanied by a priority on data privacy protection and model security. The goal was to ensure that applying these techniques for predictive analysis and model building would keep the data secure and untampered, providing safe and reliable solutions for real-world business problems.

Lastly, gaining a comprehensive understanding of basic information security concepts and best practices was crucial. The focus was on learning how to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data throughout the entire data processing and analysis process, ultimately aiming to enhance technical skills and become a well-rounded data professional with a strong emphasis on data security.
