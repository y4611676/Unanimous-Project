A : Using python in Jupyter notebook helps notify and adjusting in short period of time, by running code in a line with short time, and gives out result after running saving lots of time, therefore I can check the data every now and then, and it can document every steps I take.

ROCCC analysis

Analyze process : 

Q : A summary of my analysis 

A : 

Correlation between the number of steps and the calories burned by the users. We can see on the graph below a positive correlation: 
the more active the user is, the more significant the number of burned calories is.

Correlation between the number of hours slept and the number of hours spent in bed. The data points are very close, and the correlation is equally strong. 
If users want to enhance their well-being, it is evident that the time spent in bed must be increased.

While the average sedentary activity clearly dominates, it appears that there are no differences in activity levels based on the days of the week, regardless of the type of activity.

Average number of steps per week among users. The graph below seems to confirm the initial impression.
However, the weekends and Wednesdays show a slight increase compared to the other days of the week, which could be explained by non-working days.
